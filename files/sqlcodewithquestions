SELECT TOP 5
    body_type,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_listings
FROM 
    usedcarlisting
GROUP BY 
    body_type
ORDER BY 
    number_of_listings DESC;


2. City-Based Listings

SELECT
city_corrected,
COUNT(*) AS number_of_listings
FROM
usedcarlisting
GROUP BY

GROUP BY 
    price_type
ORDER BY 
    average_price DESC;



4. Most Expensive Cars


Question: List the top 10 most expensive cars (include make, model, price, and city), filtering only 
for cars with "Excellent" engine condition.

SELECT TOP 10
    listing_number,
    make, 
    car_name, 
    price, 
    city_corrected,
    CASE 
        WHEN engine_repaired = 0 THEN 'No' 
        WHEN engine_repaired = 1 THEN 'Yes' 
    END AS engine_repair_status

    make, 
    car_name, 
    price,
    city_corrected,
    CASE WHEN rear_camera = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_rear_camera,

    CASE WHEN navigation = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_navigation,
    CASE WHEN cruise_control = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_cruise_control
FROM 
    usedcarlisting

    AND price_type = 'Budget Car'
    AND (
        (CASE WHEN rear_camera = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
         CASE WHEN leather_seats = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
         CASE WHEN navigation = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
         CASE WHEN cruise_control = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 3
    )
ORDER BY 
    price ASC;


6. Transmission Type Popularity


Question: What percentage of cars have "Automatic" transmission vs. "Manual" transmission?

SELECT 
    transmission,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_cars,
    CAST(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS percentage
FROM 
    usedcarlisting
WHERE 
    transmission IN ('Automatic Transmission', 'Manual Transmission')  -- Filters only these two types
GROUP BY 
    transmission
ORDER BY 
    number_of_cars DESC;

Alternative method is using Subquery 

SELECT 
    transmission,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_cars,
    CAST(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) 
                            FROM usedcarlisting 
                            WHERE transmission IN ('Automatic Transmission', 'Manual Transmission')) 
                            AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS percentage
FROM 
    usedcarlisting
WHERE 
    transmission IN ('Automatic Transmission', 'Manual Transmission')
GROUP BY 
    transmission;

    MIN(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS minimum_price,
    MAX(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS maximum_price

    FROM 
        usedcarlisting
    WHERE 
        price_type = 'Luxury Car'
    GROUP BY

    FROM 
        LuxuryCarsByCity
    ORDER BY 
        luxury_car_count DESC
),
CommonBodyType AS (
    SELECT TOP 1

        COUNT(*) AS body_type_count
    FROM 
        usedcarlisting
    WHERE 
        price_type = 'Luxury Car'
        AND city_corrected = (SELECT city_corrected FROM TopCity)
    GROUP BY 
        body_type
    ORDER BY 
        body_type_count DESC
)
SELECT 
    t.city_corrected AS top_luxury_city,
    t.luxury_car_count,
    c.body_type AS most_common_body_type,
    c.body_type_count,
    CAST(c.body_type_count * 100.0 / t.luxury_car_count AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS percentage
FROM 
    TopCity t
CROSS JOIN 
    CommonBodyType c;


9. Year-Wise Price Trends


Question: How does the average price of cars change based on their manufacturing year (e.g., 2015 vs. 2020 models)?

SELECT 
    year AS manufacturing_year,
    COUNT(*) AS cars_listed,
    AVG(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS avg_price,
    MIN(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS min_price,
    MAX(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS max_price,
    FORMAT(AVG(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))), 'N0') AS formatted_avg_price,
    LAG(AVG(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))), 1) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_avg,
    AVG(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))) - LAG(AVG(CAST(price AS DECIMAL(18,2))), 1) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS year_over_year_diff
FROM 
    usedcarlisting
WHERE 
    year BETWEEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - 10 AND YEAR(GETDATE())  -- Last 10 years
    AND price > 0  -- Exclude invalid prices
GROUP BY 
    year
ORDER BY 
    year DESC;
